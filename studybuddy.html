      <div class="bold-title">Surveys</div>
      <p>During this process, I aimed to gather insights that would inform a design better suited to the needs of the
        online student community. To achieve this, I developed a survey with the following questions to capture the
        experiences and perspectives of online students:
        
        How connected do you feel to your fellow students as an online learner?
        
        Do you experience feelings of isolation as an online student?
        
        How easy or difficult is it for you to form study groups with your classmates?
        
        In what ways has being an online student positively impacted you?
        
        
        What challenges have you faced as an online student?
        
        Do you wish it were easier to connect with classmates who share your major and courses?
        
        The survey was distributed via a Google Form posted on the OSU Ecampus Facebook group. Participants were invited
        to answer the questions, providing valuable qualitative data. No direct observations were conducted during this
        research phase.

    <section>
      <div class="bold-title">Wireframes</div>
      <p>Using Figma, the design process began with the creation of low-fidelity wireframes that served as a visual blueprint for 
        the app's layout, navigation, and key features. These wireframes helped outline the structure and user flow, making it easier 
        to identify potential design challenges early on. Building on this foundation, interactive prototypes were developed in Figma 
        to simulate the user experience. This iterative approach allowed for user testing and feedback, which was then used to refine 
        the design and ensure that the final product is both user-friendly and aligned with the needs of the target audience.
      </p>

    <section>
      <div class="bold-title">UX Metrics</div>
      <p>The participant found the concept enticing. Improvements in visual differentiation, navigation, and error
        prevention were assessed after survey was obtained. Overall, the evaluation identified critical areas for
        refinement to enhance the app’s user experience. From the metrics gathered, online students could benefit from
        this app.</p>

    <section>
      <div class="bold-title">Learnings</div>
      <p>This project enhanced my skills in user experience design, particularly through iterative prototyping in Figma
        and heuristic evaluation. I gained valuable insights into online student behavior, discovering that while
        flexibility allows students to balance work, study, and personal responsibilities, it also contributes to a
        sense of isolation. Overall, this project reaffirmed the importance of designing digital platforms that leverage
        the benefits of online learning while actively addressing its challenges.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <div class="bold-title">Next Steps</div>
      <p>While time and resource constraints limited the scope of certain enhancements, I would have loved to further
        explore in-depth user research sessions, including focus groups and real-world testing scenarios. This deeper
        dive could have provided richer insights into user behavior and preferences, particularly regarding the
        challenges of online learning. I would also like to add real-time communication and scheduling, integrating live
        chat and scheduling tools, to improve user interaction.</p>
